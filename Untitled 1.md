# 🥣 From Cereal to Sanity

# My 30-Day Breakfast Challenge

I have a confession to make… I’m a cereal merchant.

No, not the sugary neon-colored kind with cartoon mascots. I’m talking about the M&S “healthy” range. The 1, 5, and 6 ingredient boxes? Genuinely decent. Quick, clean, no faff. But still… it’s just pour, crunch, go. Feels more like fuelling up than actually eating. It could be worse, at least it's not neon.

And what I’ve started to realise is that I want my mornings to feel a bit more intentional. A bit more made. Not just swallowed between emails and door slams.

Recently, I’ve had more structure forced into my mornings anyway. I volunteered for the school run. Every weekday, 8:45 drop-off. It’s hard, but it’s made me consistent. I’m waking up earlier, going to the gym, and getting into uni at a decent time. That alone has been a game-changer.

So now feels like the right time to level up the rest of the morning too.

This month, I’m challenging myself to actually cook breakfast. Not every day, but enough to make it a habit.

Now that you know how much I love breakfast, let me tell you about my breakfast history.

Since I was a kid, it’s always been cereal. I LOVE breakfast. I don’t care if it’s the same cereal every day, I will wake up excited to eat my cookie crisps. Nothing can rush me into skipping breakfast. I don’t leave the house without it.

I’m super health conscious so I started looking into healthier cereals and protein cereals. The protein ones were expensive like Surreal and Eleat. I settled on Fuel, which was still pricey but not as much. Then I realised this granola wasn’t much better thanks to the high sugar and all that. So I toned it down to Weetabix, the protein packed one. Cereal doesn’t get much better than that.

Of course I had to add stuff to it. I discovered so many good toppings. ALL the berries. Strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries. Of course a banana for energy. Dates so sweet you don’t need Frosties. A handful of different nuts. A sprinkle of whatever was in Liam’s baby superfood drawer, like chia seeds and desiccated coconut. That list wasn’t a selection, I would add all of them every time. I loved it and didn’t get bored.

I added so many toppings I actually had to upgrade my cereal bowl because they didn’t fit. I used a mixing bowl instead. It was nearly just as quick as regular cereal, especially if I prepped everything in the bowl the night before and just added milk in the morning. I also had plans to alternate with porridge or yogurt instead of milk, but never really tried them much.

As a backup, if I was ever in a super rush, I had the plan B Weetabix — Minis. A bit chocolaty and not as healthy as the original which is unbeatable because it’s literally pure wheat with only protein added. But the Minis tasted good and are probably the healthiest traditional cereal you could get without going into pure grains.

The issue was, I fell off. I gravitated more and more towards the Minis. Eventually I hadn’t made my big Weetabix fruit bowls in months and was sneaking in the odd Krave. It’s hard to resist when it’s right there in the cereal cupboard.

But at nearly age 30, it was time for a change. I got into egg toast sandwiches and loved it. The same ones my mum made me on weekends when I’d wake up after her. I asked her to show me how she did it. Basically how to fry an egg — don’t judge me. I might have started late by following Gordon Ramsay’s egg frying tutorial while cooking along at the same time. I might have got burn marks in the process. But at least I started.

I made my own egg toasts for a couple of weeks. Once I got used to it, my mind and body were into it. I’d naturally wake up 15 minutes earlier to make my egg toast, even when I had morning lectures. It lasted a couple of weeks.

Then guess what happened. I fell off again. One of those things where day by day nothing changes, but looking back, everything is different. One morning I must’ve woken up too late. And if you know me, I don’t leave without breakfast. So I must’ve eaten a quick cereal and never made a toast again. That’s all it takes to lose a streak. I ended up back on the Weetabix Minis. One day can make all the difference.

Recently, M&S came out with a new line and I’ve been having that. I upgraded the Minis to the M&S “only X ingredients” line. The lineup is literally based on numbers. One for the one ingredient cereal — just corn. Five for the five ingredient multigrain hoops. You can add one extra for the chocolate version, which makes six. Being a cereal muncher and health conscious, I was excited to try them out.

I tried them in order of ingredients. Starting with the one. It wasn’t bad, but let’s just say… I can see why cereal usually has more than one ingredient. It wasn’t the taste, but the texture wasn’t great. Not enough crunch and a bit sticky. The five though? Perfect texture. They really nailed it. The taste was almost non-existent, but that’s okay. With cold milk and crunch, that’s all I need. I don’t need sugar or sweetness.

I thought the six would hit the mark but the chocolate flavour was weird. Nothing like Krave. But it worked as a mix-in. I realised I could sprinkle some of them into my five bowl to add a bit of contrast.

So that’s my current go-to healthy cereal. Multigrain hoops, five ingredients, with a layer of the six choco hoops. But again, now that I’m even closer to 30, it’s time for a change.

**The 30-Day Plan**

**Goal:** Cook a real breakfast five days a week. No boxes. No shortcuts. Just proper food that I’ve actually made.

**Structure:**

- **Weekdays:** One go-to recipe, repeated through the week. Fast, familiar, efficient.
    
- **Weekends:** One new recipe, something a bit longer or different to try.
    
- **Treats:** A few sweet options saved for slow mornings or when I need a little pick-me-up.
    

Four weeks, four core recipes. Build the habit. Keep it tasty.

**Why Bother?** Because breakfast is the first thing I do just for me.

It sets the tone. For the gym. For work. For how I show up as a parent. And I’m done with starting the day in survival mode. If I can get four solid, healthy, satisfying breakfasts locked in, that’s something I can lean on for life.

**Breakfast Ideas I Considered**

**Weekday Winners:**

1. **Avocado toast with egg** Fast, filling, and adaptable. Great for adding greens or extra toppings.
    
2. **Scrambled egg wrap with spinach and mushrooms** One pan. High protein. Easy to prep bits the night before.
    
3. **Overnight oats with chia, almond milk, banana** Cold, prepped the night before, ready to go.
    
4. **Greek yogurt bowl with berries, granola, and nut butter** Cold but filling. Easy to change up with different fruit or seeds.
    
5. **Peanut butter and banana toast with cinnamon** Surprisingly satisfying. Quick. Balanced with carbs, fat, and a touch of sweet.
    
6. **Boiled eggs with seeded toast and avocado or hummus** Easy to batch-boil. Feels fresh. Protein-rich.
    

**Weekend Slows:**

1. **Shakshuka** Not weekday practical, but a big vibe on Saturday or Sunday.
    
2. **Spinach and feta omelette with sourdough** Savoury, rich, and satisfying.
    
3. **Halloumi breakfast sandwich** Toasted bun, grilled halloumi, tomato, greens. Treat yourself.
    
4. **Chickpea breakfast hash** Spiced, hearty, and hits different.
    
5. **Turkish eggs (cılbır)** Poached eggs over garlicky yogurt with paprika butter. Yes please.
    

**Sweet Treats:**

1. **Protein pancakes** Good macros, still feels like a treat.
    
2. **French toast with berries** Sunday brunch energy.
    
3. **Breakfast banana muffins (batch bake)** Grab-and-go, healthier than it sounds.
    
4. **Chia pudding with mango or berry compote** Prep ahead. Feels indulgent but is packed with good stuff.
    

**The Final Four**

Here’s what I’m starting with for each week:

- **Week 1:** Avocado toast with egg
    
- **Week 2:** Egg and veg wrap
    
- **Week 3:** Overnight oats
    
- **Week 4:** Greek yogurt bowl
    

That gives me:

- 2 cooked, 2 cold
    
- 2 savoury, 2 sweet
    
- All doable in under 15 minutes once I get the hang of it
    

And for the weekends? Shakshuka, pancakes, or something new from the list above.

**What I’m Hoping For**

- Less chaos in the mornings
    
- More energy throughout the day
    
- A moment that feels like mine
    
- And a little sense of momentum, because starting with a win just makes everything else easier
    

I’ll check back at the end of the month to share what worked, what flopped, and whether I’m officially a breakfast person now.

Until then, it’s about showing up, trying things out, and turning breakfast into something worth waking up for.

**Want to follow along or join in?** Let me know. I’m happy to share the weekly recipes and tweaks as I go.
