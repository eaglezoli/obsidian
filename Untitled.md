# ü•£ From Cereal to Sanity
# My 30-Day Breakfast Challenge

I have a confession to make‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a cereal merchant.

No, not the sugary neon-colored kind with cartoon mascots. I‚Äôm talking about the M&S ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù range. The 1, 5, and 6 ingredient boxes? Genuinely decent. Quick, clean, no faff. But still‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just pour, crunch, go. Feels more like fuelling up than actually eating.

And what I‚Äôve started to realise is that I want my mornings to feel a bit more *intentional*. A bit more *made*. Not just swallowed between emails and door slams.

Recently, I‚Äôve had more structure forced into my mornings anyway ‚Äî I volunteered for the school run. Every weekday, 8:45 drop-off. It‚Äôs hard, but it‚Äôs made me consistent. I‚Äôm waking up earlier, going to the gym, and getting into uni at a decent time. That alone has been a game-changer.

So now feels like the right time to level up the rest of the morning too.

This month, I‚Äôm challenging myself to actually cook breakfast. Not every day ‚Äî but enough to make it a habit.

‚∏ª

**The 30-Day Plan**

**Goal:**
Cook a real breakfast five days a week. No boxes. No shortcuts. Just proper food that I‚Äôve actually made.

**Structure:**
* **Weekdays:** One go-to recipe, repeated through the week ‚Äî fast, familiar, efficient.
* **Weekends:** One new recipe, something a bit longer or different to try.
* **Treats:** A few sweet options saved for slow mornings or when I need a little pick-me-up.

Four weeks, four core recipes. Build the habit. Keep it tasty.

‚∏ª

**Why Bother?**
Because breakfast is the first thing I do just for *me*.

It sets the tone ‚Äî for the gym, for work, for how I show up as a parent. And I‚Äôm done with starting the day in survival mode. If I can get four solid, healthy, satisfying breakfasts locked in? That‚Äôs something I can lean on for life.

**Breakfast Ideas I Considered**

**Weekday Winners:**
 1. **Avocado toast with egg**
Fast, filling, and adaptable. Great for adding greens or extra toppings.
 2. **Scrambled egg wrap with spinach and mushrooms**
One pan. High protein. Easy to prep bits the night before.
 3. **Overnight oats with chia, almond milk, banana**
Cold, prepped the night before, ready to go.
 4. **Greek yogurt bowl with berries, granola, and nut butter**
Cold but filling. Easy to change up with different fruit or seeds.
 5. **Peanut butter & banana toast with cinnamon**
Surprisingly satisfying. Quick. Balanced with carbs, fat, and a touch of sweet.
 6. **Boiled eggs with seeded toast and avocado or hummus**
Easy to batch-boil. Feels fresh. Protein-rich.

**Weekend Slows:**
 1. **Shakshuka**
Not weekday practical, but a big vibe on Saturday or Sunday.
 2. **Spinach and feta omelette with sourdough**
Savoury, rich, and satisfying.
 3. **Halloumi breakfast sandwich**
Toasted bun, grilled halloumi, tomato, greens ‚Äî treat yourself.
 4. **Chickpea breakfast hash**
Spiced, hearty, and hits different.
 5. **Turkish eggs (√ßƒ±lbƒ±r)**
Poached eggs over garlicky yogurt with paprika butter. Yes please.

**Sweet Treats:**
 1. **Protein pancakes**
Good macros, still feels like a treat.
 2. **French toast with berries**
Sunday brunch energy.
 3. **Breakfast banana muffins (batch bake)**
Grab-and-go, healthier than it sounds.
 4. **Chia pudding with mango or berry compote**
Prep ahead. Feels indulgent but is packed with good stuff.

‚∏ª

**The Final Four**

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm starting with for each week:
* **Week 1:** Avocado toast with egg
* **Week 2:** Egg & veg wrap
* **Week 3:** Overnight oats
* **Week 4:** Greek yogurt bowl

That gives me:
* 2 cooked, 2 cold
* 2 savoury, 2 sweet
* All doable in under 15 minutes once I get the hang of it

And for the weekends? Shakshuka, pancakes, or something new from the list above.

‚∏ª

**What I‚Äôm Hoping For**
* Less chaos in the mornings
* More energy throughout the day
* A moment that feels like mine
* And a little sense of momentum ‚Äî because starting with a win just makes everything else easier

I‚Äôll check back at the end of the month to share what worked, what flopped, and whether I‚Äôm officially a breakfast person now.

Until then ‚Äî it‚Äôs about showing up, trying things out, and turning breakfast into something worth waking up for.
