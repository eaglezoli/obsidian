## Slide 1: Title & Overview

**Title:** Redesigning a Biomedical Engineering Lab Module for Practical Skill Development and Digital Confidence  
**Your Name**  
**MA Academic Practice â€“ EDM106**

* * *

## Slide 2: Context & Problem

- Current module relies heavily on LabVIEW and MATLAB
- Students report low confidence using oscilloscopes and understanding ECG lab setups
- Python is now more widely used in NHS and medtech industry
- Students struggle to transfer theory to practical contexts

* * *

## Slide 3: Rationale

- Need to bridge gap between theoretical understanding and hands-on application
- Institutional push toward employability, practical skills, and digital fluency
- My own experience: students asking for clearer support and more relevant tools
- Aligns with feedback from alumni and NHS stakeholders

* * *

## Slide 4: Literature & Pedagogical Models

- **Constructive Alignment** (Biggs, 1996): align outcomes, activities, assessments
- **Backward Design** (Wiggins & McTighe): plan from intended learning outcomes
- **Experiential Learning** (Kolb): active engagement boosts understanding
- These models justify shifting to flipped, project-based formats

* * *

## Slide 5: Design Goals

- Replace LabVIEW/MATLAB with Python for wider applicability
- Improve oscilloscope and ECG project confidence
- Support scaffolded learning through flipped and blended design
- Connect learning outcomes to real-world biomedical challenges

* * *

## Slide 6: Delivery Model

- Pre-lab videos: Python basics, signal examples, oscilloscope demos
- Flipped learning: theory and basic coding learned at home
- In-lab: hands-on ECG projects, peer work, staff guidance
- Digital worksheets & code templates to reduce entry barriers

* * *

## Slide 7: Accessibility & Inclusivity

- Visual code examples and narrated tutorials for different learning styles
- Scaffolded lab tasks for varying coding backgrounds
- Flexible access to materials (asynchronous options)
- Peer support and low-stakes practice tasks

* * *

## Slide 8: Stakeholder Input

- Informed by feedback from:

    - NHS biomedical science partners (tools & relevance)
    - Alumni working in medtech (Python &gt; LabVIEW)
    - Students requesting clearer practical links

* * *

## Slide 9: Evaluation Strategy

- Student confidence surveys (before/after intervention)
- Short coding/ECG practical assessment
- Focus group or written feedback post-module
- Optional: stakeholder review of alignment to professional needs

* * *

## Slide 10: Reflection

- Challenges: balancing depth with accessibility, staff training
- Benefit: clearer link between university learning and professional expectations
- Personal takeaway: research-informed curriculum change is essential

* * *

## Slide 11: Summary / Closing

- This redesign responds to learner needs, professional context, and pedagogical theory
- It aims to build competence, confidence, and industry relevance
- Questions welcome
