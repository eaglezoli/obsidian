## Data Analysis

- Mixed effects model has funnel shape
	- Tried log transform of AUC 
		- Helped, but still funnelled the other way

**Next**
- Just go with the mixed effects models as it is (with the funnel)
	- Currently just linear, try upgrade to non-linear
		- Generalised Additive Model (GAM) â€“ nonlinear and multiple predictors 'added'
- Look at statistical methods of Thomas and other papers
- Maybe try ANOVA
- KEEP IT SIMPLE!
	- Just focus on what I need to finish the chapter
	- Doesn't need to be a volume of statistical study
	- Can always continue the research afterwards
