## Data Analysis

- Mixed effects model has funnel shape
	- Tried log transform of AUC 
		- Helped, but still funnelled the other way
**Next**
- Just go with the mixed effects models as it is (with the funnel)
	- Currently just linear, try upgrade to non-linear
- Maybe try ANOVA
- Look at statistical methods of Thomas and other papers
