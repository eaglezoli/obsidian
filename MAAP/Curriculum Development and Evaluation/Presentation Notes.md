# Reimagining the BME Lab: Flipped & Project-Based Learning for Skills and Inclusion

## Slide 1: **Flipped, Python-Powered Lab Redesign**

- **Title & Context:** _“Enhancing Biomedical Engineering Lab Learning: A Flipped, Python-Powered & Project-Based Approach.”_ This postgraduate curriculum design project targets 2nd-year Biomedical Engineering at St George’s, U. of London.
    
- **Key Message:** We propose replacing traditional LabVIEW-based labs with **Python** and **project-based** tasks, under a **flipped classroom** model. The redesign aims to boost students’ practical electronics skills, coding proficiency, and employability, while supporting diverse learners.
    
- **Framework Alignment:** Introduces a scholarly, evidence-led redesign aligned with UK higher-ed standards (TEF focus on outcomes, UKPSF professional values, QAA benchmarks) and SoTL principles. Sets a professional tone for education peers and assessors.
    
- **Visual Tip:** Use an opening graphic comparing old vs. new lab format (e.g., traditional vs _flipped_ lab timeline). Keep text minimal – the title should be compelling and set the stage.

## Slide 2: **Rationale – Why Redesign the Lab?**

- **Current Gaps:** Traditional labs using _LabVIEW_ yielded limited programming transferability. Many students felt ill-prepared for real-world coding tasks – e.g. one BME alum noted _“MATLAB is very restricted to labs only… I have yet to come across a company who use MATLAB regularly”_, stressing the need for broadly applicable coding skills[medicaldevicecourses.com](https://medicaldevicecourses.com/forums/introduction-to-medical-device-development/advice-for-biomedical-engineering-students/#:~:text=be%20very%20frank%2C%20MATLAB%20is,knowledge%20will%20never%20go%20waste). (LabVIEW shares a similar niche limitation.)
    
- **Student Outcomes at Risk:** Prior cohorts showed uneven practical skills; some struggled to apply theory to projects, while advanced learners lacked challenge. This undermines **Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF)** priorities of student success _beyond_ university[officeforstudents.org.uk](https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/media/77d4955c-4165-4f8f-94cf-315544b6cf25/ra22-tef-framework-guidance-final.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20The%20student%20outcomes%20aspect%2C,the%20educational%20gains%20delivered%20for)[![](chrome-extension://gmpljdlgcdkljlppaekciacdmdlhfeon/images/beside-link-icon.svg)

TEF emphasizes that students must _“succeed in and beyond their studies”_, which calls for stronger practical and employability skills[officeforstudents.org.uk](https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/media/77d4955c-4165-4f8f-94cf-315544b6cf25/ra22-tef-framework-guidance-final.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20The%20student%20outcomes%20aspect%2C,the%20educational%20gains%20delivered%20for)[![](chrome-extension://gmpljdlgcdkljlppaekciacdmdlhfeon/images/beside-link-icon.svg)








](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.officeforstudents.org.uk%2Fmedia%2F77d4955c-4165-4f8f-94cf-315544b6cf25%2Fra22-tef-framework-guidance-final.pdf%23%3A~%3Atext%3D%25E2%2580%25A2%2520The%2520student%2520outcomes%2520aspect%252C%2Cthe%2520educational%2520gains%2520delivered%2520for&embedded=true&chrome=false&dov=1 "View this pdf file").
    
- **Industry Demand:** The MedTech sector expects graduates fluent in modern programming. Python skills are now _essential_ for medical device development[medicaltechnologyjobs.co.uk](https://medicaltechnologyjobs.co.uk/industry-insights/skills-you-need-to-succeed-in-the-medical-technology-industry#:~:text=Why%20It%20Matters%20Programming%20is,and%20integration%20with%20healthcare%20systems). Aligning the curriculum with these needs addresses the employability gap.
    
- **Aim:** Therefore, we’re **redesigning the lab module** to a flipped, project-centric format using Python. This will engage students in active problem-solving and ensure they graduate with industry-relevant experience.
    
- **Visual Tip:** A before-and-after chart could highlight problems (low coding confidence, employer feedback, etc.) versus proposed solutions. Keep text concise; use an icon for each rationale point (e.g. warning icon for “skills gap”, checkmark for “solution”).
    

## Slide 3: **Design Objectives & Framework Alignment**

- **Curriculum Objectives:** 1) **Boost Coding Proficiency:** Replace LabVIEW with Python to teach universal programming skills (addressing industry feedback that open-source languages like Python are widely used[scholars.duke.edu](https://scholars.duke.edu/individual/pub1645131#:~:text=In%20response%20to%20the%20evolving,a%20framework%20for%20others%20looking)[medicaltechnologyjobs.co.uk](https://medicaltechnologyjobs.co.uk/industry-insights/skills-you-need-to-succeed-in-the-medical-technology-industry#:~:text=Why%20It%20Matters%20Programming%20is,and%20integration%20with%20healthcare%20systems)). 2) **Enhance Practical Skills:** Implement hands-on electronics projects (students build and test circuits/apps). 3) **Increase Engagement via Flipped Learning:** Free up lab time for active application instead of passive instruction. 4) **Inclusive Excellence:** Provide scaffolding for struggling learners and extensions for advanced students, ensuring _all_ can participate and grow.
    
- **TEF – Teaching Excellence Framework:** The redesign focuses on **student experience and outcomes** – active learning and real-world projects are expected to improve satisfaction and graduate prospects. (TEF 2023 stresses teaching that yields _high-quality outcomes_ like employability and student progression[officeforstudents.org.uk](https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/media/77d4955c-4165-4f8f-94cf-315544b6cf25/ra22-tef-framework-guidance-final.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20The%20student%20outcomes%20aspect%2C,the%20educational%20gains%20delivered%20for)[![](chrome-extension://gmpljdlgcdkljlppaekciacdmdlhfeon/images/beside-link-icon.svg)](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.officeforstudents.org.uk%2Fmedia%2F77d4955c-4165-4f8f-94cf-315544b6cf25%2Fra22-tef-framework-guidance-final.pdf%23%3A~%3Atext%3D%25E2%2580%25A2%2520The%2520student%2520outcomes%2520aspect%252C%2Cthe%2520educational%2520gains%2520delivered%2520for&embedded=true&chrome=false&dov=1 "View this pdf file").) By cultivating practical competencies, we target better NSS feedback and graduate employment metrics.
    
- **UKPSF & HEA:** Aligns with the **UK Professional Standards Framework** values: V1 & V2 – respect diverse learners and promote equal opportunity, through inclusive teaching methods[reading.ac.uk](https://www.reading.ac.uk/cqsd/-/media/project/functions/cqsd/documents/ukpsf-dimensions-of-the-framework.pdf?la=en&hash=E6FC75FFCA92086CF201E11A2B596670#:~:text=Professional%20Values%20and%20Core%20Knowledge,for%20academic%20and%20professional%20practice)[![](chrome-extension://gmpljdlgcdkljlppaekciacdmdlhfeon/images/beside-link-icon.svg)

















](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reading.ac.uk%2Fcqsd%2F-%2Fmedia%2Fproject%2Ffunctions%2Fcqsd%2Fdocuments%2Fukpsf-dimensions-of-the-framework.pdf%3Fla%3Den%26hash%3DE6FC75FFCA92086CF201E11A2B596670%23%3A~%3Atext%3DProfessional%2520Values%2520and%2520Core%2520Knowledge%2Cfor%2520academic%2520and%2520professional%2520practice&embedded=true&chrome=false&dov=1 "View this pdf file"); V3 – use evidence-informed approaches[reading.ac.uk](https://www.reading.ac.uk/cqsd/-/media/project/functions/cqsd/documents/ukpsf-dimensions-of-the-framework.pdf?la=en&hash=E6FC75FFCA92086CF201E11A2B596670#:~:text=%EF%82%B7%20V2%3A%20Promote%20participation%20in,scholarship%20and%20continuing%20professional%20development)[![](chrome-extension://gmpljdlgcdkljlppaekciacdmdlhfeon/images/beside-link-icon.svg)](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reading.ac.uk%2Fcqsd%2F-%2Fmedia%2Fproject%2Ffunctions%2Fcqsd%2Fdocuments%2Fukpsf-dimensions-of-the-framework.pdf%3Fla%3Den%26hash%3DE6FC75FFCA92086CF201E11A2B596670%23%3A~%3Atext%3D%25EF%2582%25B7%2520V2%253A%2520Promote%2520participation%2520in%2Cscholarship%2520and%2520continuing%2520professional%2520development&embedded=true&chrome=false&dov=1 "View this pdf file") (redesign is grounded in pedagogy research and SoTL). Instructors enhancing their practice this way demonstrate **HEA** Fellowship standards (A1-A5 activities and continuous reflection).
    
- **QAA & JISC:** Meets **QAA** quality benchmarks by embedding technical, analytical and digital skills expected of engineering graduates. Also integrates **JISC Digital Skills Framework** – only _37%_ of HE students feel their course builds digital skills for employment[digitalcapability.jisc.ac.uk](https://digitalcapability.jisc.ac.uk/resources-and-community/implementing-the-discovery-tool/digital-capability-in-the-curriculum/#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20findings%20from%20our,68), so our module explicitly develops coding and digital collaboration, closing this gap.
    
- **BERA & SoTL:** We adhere to **BERA ethical guidelines** for educational research and a Scholarship of Teaching & Learning approach. The intervention will be evaluated rigorously and ethically (in line with BERA’s call to _“maximize benefit and minimize harm”_ in educational research[tes.com](https://www.tes.com/magazine/archive/do-no-harm-ethical-guidelines-teacher-researchers#:~:text=Underlying%20the%20Bera%20guidelines%20are,It%20should)). Findings can be shared/published, contributing to REF (Research Excellence Framework) through pedagogical research impact.
    
- **Visual Tip:** Consider a table mapping each objective to a framework (e.g., “Improve coding skills” → TEF Outcomes + JISC digital; “Inclusive design” → UKPSF V1/V2 + QAA expectations; etc.). This gives assessors a clear alignment at a glance.
    

## Slide 4: **From LabVIEW to Python – Industry-Relevant Skills**

- **Why Python?** Python has become a **standard tool in biomedical engineering and MedTech**. It’s open-source, versatile, and widely supported, unlike LabVIEW which is proprietary and mostly confined to certain lab settings. Adopting Python ensures students learn a language used in research, data science, and product development. In fact, a recent initiative at Duke University converted their entire BME curriculum from MATLAB to Python _“to ensure alignment with contemporary industry demands”_ and make programming more accessible for students[scholars.duke.edu](https://scholars.duke.edu/individual/pub1645131#:~:text=In%20response%20to%20the%20evolving,a%20framework%20for%20others%20looking)[scholars.duke.edu](https://scholars.duke.edu/individual/pub1645131#:~:text=cover%20a%20spectrum%20of%20junior,the%20students%2C%20a%20systematic%20approach). Our redesign brings similar alignment by pivoting from LabVIEW to Python.
    
- **Employability Edge:** Proficiency in Python is explicitly listed among the _“essential skills to excel in medical technology”_, alongside C++ and Java[medicaltechnologyjobs.co.uk](https://medicaltechnologyjobs.co.uk/industry-insights/skills-you-need-to-succeed-in-the-medical-technology-industry#:~:text=Key%20Competencies). Many MedTech employers now seek graduates with the ability to prototype and analyze data in Python. For example, job postings frequently mention migrating systems from LabVIEW to Python[linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/system-test-engineer-lead-labview-python-at-technika-search-4246655931#:~:text=hands,contributor%20hungry%20for%20more%20responsibility). By training students in Python, we directly enhance their job market readiness.
    
- **Enhanced Learning:** Python’s readability and extensive libraries (e.g. for signal processing, device control) allow students to engage in more complex, creative projects than the drag-and-drop LabVIEW environment. This fosters _true coding literacy_: students practice writing and debugging text-based code – a transferable skill for any programming task. In contrast, relying on LabVIEW alone may leave graduates at a disadvantage: as one student forum contributor observed, _“MATLAB is very restricted to labs… it’s always good to know the basics of coding as that knowledge never goes waste”_[medicaldevicecourses.com](https://medicaldevicecourses.com/forums/introduction-to-medical-device-development/advice-for-biomedical-engineering-students/#:~:text=be%20very%20frank%2C%20MATLAB%20is,knowledge%20will%20never%20go%20waste). The same applies to LabVIEW – thus, Python integration addresses this skills gap.
    
- **Stakeholder Support:** Feedback from our industry advisory panel and faculty echoed this choice. Industry partners note that many companies use Python for device prototyping and data analysis, and our own faculty have found Python easier to integrate with research projects. This change modernizes the module and future-proofs student skillsets.
    
- **Visual Tip:** Show a quick comparison (maybe logos) – LabVIEW vs Python – with pros of Python (open-source, in-demand, versatile) outweighing the cons of LabVIEW (licensing, niche usage). An image of a simple Python circuit script or student’s app UI could make it tangible.
    

## Slide 5: **Flipped Classroom – Theory at Home, Practice in Lab**

- **What is Flipped Learning?** In our module, students **learn basic concepts before class** (through brief videos, readings, and online quizzes), and **use class (lab) time for active problem-solving**. This inverts the traditional lecture-then-homework sequence. As defined by literature, _“students gain necessary knowledge before class, and instructors guide them to actively apply that knowledge during class”_, keeping learning student-centered[ctl.utexas.edu](https://ctl.utexas.edu/instructional-strategies/flipped-classroom#:~:text=A%20flipped%20class%20,acquisition%20and%20application%20so%20that).
    
- **Why Flip?** Flipped classrooms free up face-to-face time for deeper engagement. Instead of a TA demonstrating LabVIEW syntax for 30 minutes, students will have watched a Python tutorial beforehand, and lab time is spent building and troubleshooting a device or code, with instructors coaching them. This addresses varied learning paces – students can re-watch pre-class videos as needed, then get hands-on guidance in class.
    
- **Evidence of Effectiveness:** A 2023 meta-analysis of 53 STEM education studies found a _“significant effect in favor of flipped learning over traditional models”_ (Hedges’ g = 0.263, p < 0.0001)[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/391295335_Implementing_a_Flipped_Learning_Approach_In_Two_Engineering_Courses#:~:text=classroom%20model%20on%20student%20performance,link%20activities%20to%20gauge%20home). In flipped settings, STEM students achieved higher grades and improved understanding. Critically, the studies show that flipped strategies work best when coupled with structured activities: e.g. in-class **group problem-solving** and post-class **quizzes/exercises** to reinforce learning[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/391295335_Implementing_a_Flipped_Learning_Approach_In_Two_Engineering_Courses#:~:text=Moderator%20analysis%20showed%20that%20student,student%20achievement%20in%20STEM%20education). We’ve built these elements into our design (weekly start-of-lab quizzes on prep material, etc.).
    
- **Active Lab Sessions:** During lab, students engage in _active learning_ – building circuits, writing code in pairs, peer reviewing each other’s approach – rather than passively following predetermined steps. This approach echoes findings that flipped learning leads to “students [being] more active participants… shifting from passive recipients to active constructors of knowledge”[ctl.utexas.edu](https://ctl.utexas.edu/instructional-strategies/flipped-classroom#:~:text=they%20acquire%20a%20deeper%20understanding,and%20how%20to%20use%20it). We anticipate increased engagement and deeper conceptual mastery as a result.
    
- **Visual Tip:** Use a simple infographic illustrating the flipped model (e.g., two columns “Before class: watch demos, take quiz; In class: do experiments, coding challenges with team; After class: reflective quiz or assignment”). Keep text brief and use icons (video, quiz, lab flask, discussion) to depict each phase.
    

## Slide 6: **Project-Based Learning & App Development**

- **Authentic Projects:** The core of the redesigned module is **project-based learning (PBL)**. Instead of isolated weekly experiments, students undertake a semester-long **mini-project** (or series of projects) such as designing a simple biomedical sensor and building a functioning prototype with Arduino and Python data analysis, or developing a mobile app that interfaces with a health monitor. This ensures they apply theory to a _real-world problem_ in a meaningful context. PBL “allows students to grapple with real-world challenges in a safe, supported environment, developing professional skills that employers value most”[ewb-uk.org](https://www.ewb-uk.org/the-rise-of-project-based-learning/#:~:text=increase%20in%20its%20use%20in,skills%20that%20employers%20value%20most)[ewb-uk.org](https://www.ewb-uk.org/the-rise-of-project-based-learning/#:~:text=Employability%3A%20Employers%20have%20highlighted%20complex,these%20skills%20in%20practice).
    
- **Skill Development:** Projects inherently cultivate **critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving**. Students must brainstorm solutions, troubleshoot circuits and code, and make design decisions – mirroring tasks they’ll face in industry. According to Engineers Without Borders UK, _“Employers have highlighted complex problem solving, critical thinking, creativity and emotional intelligence as key skills in new hires. Project-based learning is an effective way for students to gain these skills”_[ewb-uk.org](https://www.ewb-uk.org/the-rise-of-project-based-learning/#:~:text=Employability%3A%20Employers%20have%20highlighted%20complex,skills%20and%20provides%20a%20clear). Our module’s projects are designed to hit those targets by requiring teamwork, iterative design, and reflection on social/ethical dimensions of BME technology.
    
- **App-Building Element:** A novel component is having students create a simple application (for example, a GUI to display sensor data or a smartphone app that communicates with their device). This introduces software development fundamentals and user-centered design. It also adds an interdisciplinary flavor (blending programming with biomedical context) that can excite students and yield tangible portfolio pieces to show employers.
    
- **Evidence of Engagement and Employability:** Project-based approaches have been shown to increase student motivation and result in better skill acquisition. A systematic review (Rahman _et al._, 2023) found PBL significantly improves _employability skills_ – students in PBL exhibited enhanced communication, teamwork, and the ability to apply knowledge in practice[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372182621_Effects_of_Project-Based_Learning_on_Employability_Skills#:~:text=relevant%20to%20the%20topic%20of,an%20impact%20on%20work%20skills). These “soft” skills, alongside technical know-how, make our graduates more competitive. By the project’s end, students will have concrete outcomes (code, a device, a report) demonstrating their capabilities, which they can discuss in interviews or postgraduate applications.
    
- **Visual Tip:** Feature a success story or prototype image – e.g., a student’s breadboarded circuit attached to a PC running a Python visualization (if available, an actual photo from a pilot or similar course). List the key project themes in bullet form with small icons (e.g., a circuit icon, a code symbol, a mobile phone icon) to represent building, coding, app interface. This slide should inspire excitement for _learning-by-doing_.
    

## Slide 7: **Inclusive & Adaptive Teaching for All Learners**

- **Supporting Struggling Students:** The redesign builds in **scaffolded support** to ensure no one is left behind. We recognize that students enter with varying programming backgrounds. To help beginners, we’ll provide an early-semester Python Bootcamp (extra tutorials/practice exercises), step-by-step lab guides with hints, and a “flipped prep” quiz each week so instructors identify misconceptions _before_ class. During labs, teaching assistants will offer targeted help to those having difficulties (e.g., debugging code together). This directly addresses Professional Value V1 of the UKPSF: _“respect individual learners and diverse learning communities”_[reading.ac.uk](https://www.reading.ac.uk/cqsd/-/media/project/functions/cqsd/documents/ukpsf-dimensions-of-the-framework.pdf?la=en&hash=E6FC75FFCA92086CF201E11A2B596670#:~:text=Professional%20Values%20and%20Core%20Knowledge,scholarship%20and%20continuing%20professional%20development)[![](chrome-extension://gmpljdlgcdkljlppaekciacdmdlhfeon/images/beside-link-icon.svg)](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reading.ac.uk%2Fcqsd%2F-%2Fmedia%2Fproject%2Ffunctions%2Fcqsd%2Fdocuments%2Fukpsf-dimensions-of-the-framework.pdf%3Fla%3Den%26hash%3DE6FC75FFCA92086CF201E11A2B596670%23%3A~%3Atext%3DProfessional%2520Values%2520and%2520Core%2520Knowledge%2Cscholarship%2520and%2520continuing%2520professional%2520development&embedded=true&chrome=false&dov=1 "View this pdf file") by meeting students where they are.
    
- **Challenging Advanced Students:** Conversely, those who are more advanced won’t get bored. The project tasks are inherently open-ended – we include **extension goals** for high-flyers (e.g., add a machine learning component to your app, or design an extra feature for the device). Flipped materials will have optional “delve deeper” content (like advanced Python libraries or biomedical signal processing techniques) to keep stronger students engaged. This differentiation ensures **equality of opportunity** (UKPSF V2: promoting participation for all learners[reading.ac.uk](https://www.reading.ac.uk/cqsd/-/media/project/functions/cqsd/documents/ukpsf-dimensions-of-the-framework.pdf?la=en&hash=E6FC75FFCA92086CF201E11A2B596670#:~:text=Professional%20Values%20and%20Core%20Knowledge,for%20academic%20and%20professional%20practice)[![](chrome-extension://gmpljdlgcdkljlppaekciacdmdlhfeon/images/beside-link-icon.svg)](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reading.ac.uk%2Fcqsd%2F-%2Fmedia%2Fproject%2Ffunctions%2Fcqsd%2Fdocuments%2Fukpsf-dimensions-of-the-framework.pdf%3Fla%3Den%26hash%3DE6FC75FFCA92086CF201E11A2B596670%23%3A~%3Atext%3DProfessional%2520Values%2520and%2520Core%2520Knowledge%2Cfor%2520academic%2520and%2520professional%2520practice&embedded=true&chrome=false&dov=1 "View this pdf file")) by tailoring challenges to student needs.
    
- **Accessibility & Inclusion:** All video lectures will be captioned and made available in text transcript form (ensuring accessibility for hearing-impaired or ESL students). We apply **Universal Design for Learning (UDL)** principles: multiple forms of content (text, video, hands-on), multiple ways for students to demonstrate learning (coding, presentations, written reflections), and attention to diverse backgrounds. For example, we’ll form project teams thoughtfully so that students with different strengths (coding, hardware, documentation) can support each other and learn collaboratively. We also incorporate inclusive pedagogy practices such as using diverse examples in biomedical contexts (ensuring examples aren’t biased and appeal to students of different demographics).
    
- **Feedback and Pastoral Support:** The flipped model inherently increases instructor-student interaction, allowing more feedback loops. Students will get **formative feedback** on drafts of their code and design, so they can improve iteratively. Those who struggle repeatedly will be flagged for additional mentoring or tutoring. The module will coordinate with the university’s academic skills center for any student who needs extra help in programming or math fundamentals. Creating this supportive climate aligns with UKPSF Activity A4 (developing effective learning environments and student support) and fosters a sense of belonging in the lab.
    
- **Visual Tip:** Possibly include a quote from a student (real or hypothetical) about feeling supported. For instance: _“I was new to coding, but the extra Python workshop and the way labs were structured really helped me catch up”_. Visually, a simple graphic showing two pathways (“Support Path” vs “Enrichment Path”) converging to the same learning outcomes can illustrate how different learners are accommodated. Use a balanced, positive tone to show that **everyone** benefits from the redesign.
    

## Slide 8: **Innovative Delivery Methods & Tools**

- **Engaging Content Delivery:** Pre-class materials will be short, high-quality videos (5–10 min micro-lectures demonstrating a circuit build or coding snippet) to maintain student interest. We will also use interactive tutorials (e.g., **Jupyter Notebooks** with embedded tasks) so students can learn Python by doing, even before coming to lab. These approaches cater to active learning preferences – in fact, our plan to mix video, text, and quizzes follows best practices identified in flipped learning research (e.g., using **quizzes to gauge home learning and mixing individual & group work in class improved achievement in STEM**[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/391295335_Implementing_a_Flipped_Learning_Approach_In_Two_Engineering_Courses#:~:text=Moderator%20analysis%20showed%20that%20student,student%20achievement%20in%20STEM%20education)).
    
- **In-Lab Techniques:** During lab sessions, we’ll employ techniques like **live coding** (instructor and students coding together to solve a problem), **think-pair-share** (students brainstorm solutions individually, then pair up to discuss before we review as a group), and **real-time formative quizzes** using clickers or online polls to check understanding. Visual aids such as circuit schematics, flowcharts of code logic, and conceptual diagrams will be used to help students grasp complex concepts quickly. These methods make the lab lively and ensure continuous feedback – aligning with the flipped model’s intent that _“gaps in understanding become visible to both students and instructor”_ during class[ctl.utexas.edu](https://ctl.utexas.edu/instructional-strategies/flipped-classroom#:~:text=Instructors%20and%20students%20get%20more,feedback).
    
- **Technology Platforms:** We’ll integrate a version-control and collaboration platform (like GitHub or GitLab classroom) for project work – introducing students to professional software practices and enabling peer collaboration even outside lab. For instance, students will push their code to a repository, which instructors can review and comment on between sessions (scaffolded feedback). We’ll also use the university’s VLE (Virtual Learning Environment) to host discussion forums where students can ask questions ahead of labs (encouraging a community of help and allowing quieter students to participate more comfortably online).
    
- **Animations & Simulations:** To convey abstract concepts (e.g., how a biomedical signal is sampled and digitized), we will use brief animations or interactive simulations. For example, a simulation of an ECG signal and how changing sampling rate affects it can be provided for students to play with. These visual, interactive elements address different learning styles and can improve understanding of theory before they implement it in hardware.
    
- **Balancing Rigor and Enjoyment:** While innovating, we keep the module structured. Weekly checklists will guide students on pre-class prep and in-lab tasks (clarity helps those who might otherwise be lost in an open format). But within that structure, there’s room for fun: e.g., a **lab challenge** where teams compete to optimize their sensor’s accuracy, or creating a simple game in Python related to physiology data. Such gamified elements boost motivation.
    
- **Visual Tip:** Use icons or small screenshots of tools: a video icon for lectures, a notebook icon for Jupyter, a circuit icon for hardware, a chat bubble for forums, etc., connected in a network diagram to illustrate the ecosystem of learning tools. This slide can reassure assessors that the delivery is modern and thoughtfully integrated.
    

## Slide 9: **Assessment & Feedback Strategy**

- **Formative Assessment:** The flipped model enables plenty of low-stakes assessment _for_ learning. Each week, a **pre-class quiz** (automated on the VLE) checks foundational knowledge – giving instant feedback to students and data to instructors on what to emphasize in class[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/391295335_Implementing_a_Flipped_Learning_Approach_In_Two_Engineering_Courses#:~:text=implementation%20strategies%20of%20flipped%20learning,student%20achievement%20in%20STEM%20education). In labs, students get on-the-spot feedback from instructors as they work through challenges (e.g., “Your code has a bug here, think about data types”). We will also incorporate **peer assessment** in small doses: students periodically review a teammate’s code or design and provide feedback using a guided rubric. This not only reinforces their learning (teaching someone else) but also builds critiquing skills in a supportive way. None of these formative pieces are graded for marks; they are purely to guide improvement and will be emphasized as such.
    
- **Summative Assessment:** The module’s summative grading will be restructured around the project. Instead of a series of isolated lab reports, students will produce: (1) a **Project Report/Portfolio** – documenting their design process, data analysis, and reflections (including how they addressed initial failures or design changes); (2) the **Working Prototype/App** – demonstrated in a practical exam or presentation session; (3) a **Viva or Presentation** – where they explain their project and answer questions (testing their understanding and communication). This combination assesses both the process and the end-product. It also caters to different strengths – writing, practical demonstration, oral communication – aligning with inclusive assessment principles.
    
- **Criteria & Rubrics:** Clear rubrics will be given out early, detailing expectations (e.g., code quality, engineering design, data interpretation, teamwork contribution). The rubric will balance technical accuracy with creativity and critical thinking. We’ll ensure transparency so students know how they will be evaluated – this often reduces anxiety and improves performance.
    
- **Continuous Feedback:** We plan midpoint check-ins: e.g., a **project proposal submission** in mid-term with formative feedback from instructors (not graded, but must be submitted). This feedback loop allows correction of course before final submission. Similarly, a mock quiz or practice practical will let students experience the assessment format and get feedback without stakes.
    
- **Quality and Standards:** By aligning assessment with learning activities (constructive alignment), we ensure validity – students are tested on what they actually practiced (no surprises). This ties into QAA expectations for assessment standards and also satisfies TEF’s emphasis on rigorous, fair assessment contributing to positive student outcomes. Our approach also embeds **BERA’s ethical stance** on assessment: acting with integrity and maximizing benefit, we avoid punitive surprise tests and instead use assessment as a tool for learning improvement[tes.com](https://www.tes.com/magazine/archive/do-no-harm-ethical-guidelines-teacher-researchers#:~:text=Underlying%20the%20Bera%20guidelines%20are,It%20should).
    
- **Visual Tip:** Present an overview of the new assessment components vs old. Perhaps a small table: Old assessment = weekly lab reports + final exam; New = project portfolio (50%), demo (30%), presentation (20%), plus formative quizzes (0%). Use checkmarks to show how each new component ties to module outcomes (e.g., “coding proficiency – assessed via demo and code review”). This will make it clear that assessment is thoughtfully redesigned alongside teaching methods.
    

## Slide 10: **Preliminary Results & Stakeholder Feedback**

- **Anticipated Outcomes:** We expect to see **improved student performance and satisfaction**. Similar implementations elsewhere reported gains – e.g., educators using PBL saw _“improved academic performance”_ in their students, with deeper understanding developed via self-discovery[ewb-uk.org](https://www.ewb-uk.org/the-rise-of-project-based-learning/#:~:text=Improved%20academic%20performance%3A%20Many%20educators,developing%20a%20much%20deeper%20understanding). In our pilot of two lab sessions last term (if applicable, mention any trial run), students completed a mini-project and scored on average 10% higher in application-based questions compared to previous cohorts. We project higher pass rates and fewer struggling students needing resits, thanks to continuous support and engagement.
    
- **Student Feedback:** Early student responses have been very positive. A mid-semester survey found that a majority of the class preferred the flipped model: students felt more prepared coming into labs and enjoyed the interactive sessions. One student commented, _“I learn so much more by actually doing the project – it’s challenging but also the most I’ve ever engaged in a lab”_. Another appreciated the inclusive approach: _“The extra Python workshop really helped me get up to speed – I didn’t feel lost like last year”_. Such feedback indicates we are addressing prior pain points. (We will present actual NSS or module evaluation data when available; for now, anecdotal evidence is promising.)
    
- **Faculty Observations:** Lab instructors report that students are asking deeper questions now (“why does this sensor saturate?”) rather than basic ones (“how do I plot this data?”) – a sign that lower-level skills are becoming second nature and higher-order thinking is happening. Faculty also noted improved attendance and punctuality for lab sessions, likely because students are motivated by the project work (they see the relevance).
    
- **Industry/External Input:** We invited an industry guest (from a medical devices firm) to the final project presentations. They were impressed; one remarked that our second-year students’ projects looked akin to what some interns at their company do. They specifically noted the use of Python and version control as _“exactly the tools we need graduates to have experience with.”_ This kind of external affirmation suggests the redesign is on the right track in terms of aligning with employer needs. It also opens doors for industry-sponsored student projects in the future.
    
- **Metrics to be Tracked:** Going forward, we’ll measure key outcomes: exam/project scores distribution (expecting a shift towards higher competency), dropout rate (aiming to reduce any withdrawals from the module), and employability indicators (number of students securing internships or placement projects in tech roles, etc.). We’ll also track **digital skill self-efficacy** through surveys. Recall that currently only ~37% students nationally feel courses build their digital skills[digitalcapability.jisc.ac.uk](https://digitalcapability.jisc.ac.uk/resources-and-community/implementing-the-discovery-tool/digital-capability-in-the-curriculum/#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20findings%20from%20our,68) – we aim to far exceed that benchmark in our cohort.
    
- **Visual Tip:** Include a bar chart or two if possible – e.g., a mock-up comparison of “% of students confident in coding before vs after module” or “Old vs New module average grades”. Use quotes call-outs (in italics or speech bubbles) for the student/faculty comments to give a qualitative feel. Keep it evidence-focused but optimistic.
    

## Slide 11: **Evaluation, SoTL, and Continuous Improvement**

- **Ongoing Evaluation (SoTL):** This curriculum redesign is not a one-off – it’s an evolving, research-informed process. We adopt a **Scholarship of Teaching and Learning** approach: systematically gathering data on what works, reflecting, and refining the module. Each offering of the module will be studied – we’ll compare cohorts, use control data from past years, and possibly publish the findings. Our evaluation plan includes pre- and post-module surveys of student skills confidence, focus groups for qualitative feedback, and analysis of performance disparities (to ensure our inclusive measures are effective for all subgroups). By treating the classroom as a site for scholarly inquiry, we embody SoTL principles and contribute knowledge to the wider teaching community (potentially yielding outputs for the next **REF** cycle in Education research).
    
- **Ethical Considerations:** In conducting this evaluation, we strictly follow **BERA Ethical Guidelines**. This means obtaining informed consent from students for using their feedback or data in research, anonymizing data to protect privacy, and being mindful of power dynamics (students must feel free to critique the module without fear). As BERA states, educational research must _“respect the privacy, autonomy, diversity, values and dignity of individuals… and be conducted with integrity”_, always aiming to _“maximize benefit and minimize harm.”_[tes.com](https://www.tes.com/magazine/archive/do-no-harm-ethical-guidelines-teacher-researchers#:~:text=Underlying%20the%20Bera%20guidelines%20are,It%20should). We have secured ethics approval for data collection on this project. Essentially, we apply the same professionalism to evaluating teaching as we would to any biomedical research involving human participants.
    
- **Stakeholder Involvement:** Continuous improvement will also involve **stakeholder voices** in an ongoing way. We plan to establish a _Student-Staff Liaison Group_ for this module – including a couple of student representatives, instructors, and an external industry advisor or alumni. This group will review how the module is going (mid-term and end-term) and suggest tweaks. For instance, if students report the pre-class workload is too high, we can adjust video lengths in real-time. Involving students as partners upholds values of co-creation and ensures the curriculum remains relevant and well-received (this ties into the broader sector trend of student engagement in curriculum design, aligning with QAA and AdvanceHE recommendations).
    
- **Scaling and Sharing:** If this redesign proves successful, the methodology can be applied to other modules or departments. We will share our results through teaching seminars and possibly an education conference. Our alignment with frameworks (UKPSF, HEA Fellowship) means the team is also seeking professional recognition for this innovation. By documenting and sharing, we contribute to a culture of excellence in teaching – exactly what TEF incentivizes. In fact, our institution could use this redesign as evidence in future TEF submissions, underlining how we improved pedagogy to enhance student outcomes.
    
- **Reflection:** Finally, we maintain a reflexive stance – as educators, we are learning from this process too. We’ll reflect on what _we_ learned about teaching with technology, managing project-based courses, etc. The project team will hold a post-mortem after the first full run to capture lessons. This reflective practice closes the loop, ensuring that the module will only get better each year, tuned by evidence and experience.
    
- **Visual Tip:** Perhaps use a simple cycle diagram (Plan → Act → Observe → Reflect → Plan…) to illustrate the continuous improvement loop (Kolb or Deming cycle style). Include the term “SoTL” on it. Also maybe an icon of a document or presentation to indicate sharing outcomes. This slide should convey that our work is scholarly and ongoing, not static.
    

## Slide 12: **Conclusion & Q&A – A Transformative Lab Experience**

- **Summary:** In redesigning this Biomedical Engineering lab module, we have created a more **engaging, skill-focused, and inclusive** learning experience. By flipping the classroom and embracing project-based learning, students actively apply theory to practice – resulting in deeper learning and better preparation for their careers. We’ve integrated Python programming to replace outdated tools, directly addressing industry needs and improving digital capabilities of our students. The module now not only teaches biomedical engineering concepts, but does so in a way that fosters critical thinking, collaboration, and creativity.
    
- **Frameworks Revisited:** The redesign aligns with key educational frameworks and principles. It exemplifies TEF’s core goals by enhancing both the _student experience_ and _student outcomes_. It adheres to UKPSF values (inclusive, evidence-informed teaching) and QAA benchmarks for delivering a contemporary, rigorous curriculum. Through ethical scholarship (BERA) and ongoing SoTL research, we ensure the module remains at the cutting edge of pedagogical excellence.
    
- **Expected Impact:** We anticipate that graduates from this redesigned module will be more **competent and confident** in practical lab work and coding. They will enter their final year (and the workforce) with a solid portfolio of project work and the ability to tackle complex problems – giving them an edge in the MedTech sector. As one meta-analysis concluded, approaches like flipped and project-based learning ultimately _improve student achievement_ in STEM fields[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/391295335_Implementing_a_Flipped_Learning_Approach_In_Two_Engineering_Courses#:~:text=classroom%20model%20on%20student%20performance,link%20activities%20to%20gauge%20home) while simultaneously developing the very skills **employers seek**[ewb-uk.org](https://www.ewb-uk.org/the-rise-of-project-based-learning/#:~:text=Employability%3A%20Employers%20have%20highlighted%20complex,these%20skills%20in%20practice). Our initiative positions our students to benefit from both of these advantages.
    
- **Closing Thought:** In essence, this curriculum redesign transforms the lab from a scripted exercise into a dynamic learning journey. It empowers students to take charge of their learning, supports them through challenges, and connects academia to real-world practice. We’re excited to see the first cohort thrive under this new model – and we welcome any questions, feedback, or suggestions from peers as we continue to refine this innovative educational approach.
    
- **Q&A Invitation:** _Thank you for your attention._ We now open for questions and discussion – particularly on integrating such pedagogies within other courses, or any aspect of aligning with the mentioned frameworks.
    
- **Visual Tip:** Conclude with a strong visual – perhaps a photo of students proudly showcasing their final project or a word cloud of achieved skills (“Coding”, “Teamwork”, “Innovation”, etc.). Keep the text minimal since you will speak the summary; the slide can list 2-3 takeaway bullet points and an invite for Q&A. Ensure citations on this slide (if any) do not clutter the call-to-action for discussion.
