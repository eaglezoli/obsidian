## The launch of Study+: an interdisciplinary approach

The Study+ interdisciplinary modules are the culmination of recommendations from a deep dive consultation exercise which started in 2023.

Level 5 students enrolled in eligible legacy City programmes will have the opportunity to choose from modules designed for those new to the subject, covering broad topics such as sustainability and climate change, financial wellness, data analytics, programming, modern languages, and media and communications for business, practice and the professions.

The initiative will be rolled out to eligible students at Clerkenwell and Moorgate first, with a view to inviting eligible students at Tooting in due course.

Professor Juliet John, Vice-President (Education), said: "_I am hugely excited that Study+ will launch this September, offering a bespoke pool of modules which will enhance the educational experience and employment prospects of students who take them. A multi-disciplinary approach is needed to tackle many of the world’s biggest challenges and flexibility of mind and approach will equip students well for the ‘portfolio’ careers which will be increasingly common in a fast-moving world._ 

_"Thank you to all who have worked so hard to bring this pool of modules to fruition, to academics in Schools; and to Kathy Dale (SST Head of Academic Services) and Sandra Ashton (Education Project Manager) particularly in central Professional Services, who have enabled systems designed around disciplines to support interdisciplinary combination and choice. Our fast-growing interdisciplinary and inter-professional Portfolio will benefit from their creative problem-solving"._

Study+ is one manifestation of the broader growth of interdisciplinary opportunities across our curriculum and our campuses, equipping City St George’s students for complex challenges in a rapidly changing world.
